                    <h3>Gravity pulls hydrogen atoms together.</h3>
                    <p>Gravity causes vast clouds of hydrogen gas in space to slowly collapse inward. As the atoms move closer together, the cloud becomes denser and warmer, forming the early structure of a star.</p>

                    <p>As the core becomes hotter and denser, hydrogen atoms begin to collide and fuse together. This nuclear fusion process converts hydrogen into helium at the star’s center.</p>

                    <h3>This fusion releases tremendous energy.</h3>
                    <p>The fusion of hydrogen into helium releases enormous amounts of energy. This energy creates outward pressure that balances gravity and stabilizes the star.</p>

                    <p>Astronomy is the science that studies everything in space from the planets in our solar system to the billions of stars and galaxies spread across the universe. It helps us understand how the universe works and how everything in it is connected.</p>

                <p class="section-subtitle">Welcome to our journey through the universe, a place filled with planets, stars, galaxies, and endless mysteries waiting to be explored. Astronomy is the science that helps us understand everything beyond Earth. It teaches us how the planets move, how stars are born, why the Moon changes shape, and what lies in the deepest parts of space that we can’t even see with our eyes.</p>
            </div>
            <p>For thousands of years, humans have looked up at the night sky and wondered what the shining points of light really are. Today, thanks to telescopes, spacecraft, and amazing discoveries, we know more about the universe than ever before  but there is still so much left to learn. That’s what makes astronomy exciting. Every new discovery helps us understand our place in the universe a little better.</p>

                    <h2>Comet Trajectory</h2>
                    <p>In astronomy, a comet's trajectory serves as a bridge between the chaotic birth of the solar system and modern celestial mechanics, acting as a "fossilized" record of the gravitational forces that shaped our neighborhood. These highly eccentric paths, governed by Kepler’s Laws and Newton’s gravity, trace the history of planetary migration, as most comets were flung into the Oort Cloud or Kuiper Belt by the gravity of giant planets billions of years ago. By studying these orbits, astronomers can detect "non-gravitational" forces caused by outgassing, which revealed the existence of the solar wind, and monitor potential Earth-crossers for planetary defense. Ultimately, the trajectory of a comet is a roadmap that leads scientists back to the primordial ices and organic molecules that may have seeded life on Earth, proving that these icy wanderers are fundamental to our understanding of both our origins and our cosmic safety.</p>
